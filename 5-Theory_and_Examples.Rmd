## Doob-Meyer Theorem

Suppose that $X_t , 0 \leq t \leq \infty$, is a right-continuous
submartingale w.r.t the family $\lbrace I_t \rbrace$ and
$E(X_t) < \infty$ for all t. Then $X_t$ admits the decomposition
$X_t = \mu_t + A_t$ where:

-   $\mu_t$ is a right-continuous martingale w.r.t P
-   $A_t$ is an increasing process measurable w.r.t $I_t$

## Riemann-Stieltjes

A generalization of the Riemann integral that can be denoted as:

$$
\int_{x=a}^b f(x)dg(x)
$$

Using a sequence of partitions $P = {a = x_0 < x_1 < \dots < x_n = b}$
we can approximate the integral to be the sum:

$$
S(P,f,g) = \sum^{n-1}_{i=0} f(c_i)[g(x_{i+1}) - g(x_i)]
$$

## Girsanov Theorem {#Girsanov}

### Preliminary Setup

Define a random process and impose a cndontion in $X_t$ where it cannot
vary "too much"

$$
\begin{matrix}
\xi_t = e^{\int_0^tX_udW_u - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t X^2_udu} & t \in [0,\infty) \\
E[e^{\int_0^t X^2_udu}] < \infty  & t \in [0,\infty)
\end{matrix}
$$

Using Ito's Lemma, we can calculate

$$
d\xi_t = [e^{\int_0^tX_udW_u - \frac{1}{2} \int_0^t X^2_udu}][X_tdW_t] \rightarrow d\xi_t = \xi_tX_t dW_t
$$

By setting t = 0 we see $\xi_0 = 1$. Thus by taking the stochastic
integral of the above becomes:

$$
\xi_t = 1 + \int_0^t \xi_sX_sdW_s
$$

$\int_0^t \xi_sX_sdW_s$ is a stochastic integral with respect to a
Wiener process and is $I_t$ adapted and does not move rapidly. Implying
that this integral is a square integrable martingale.

### Theorem

If the process $\xi_t$ defined by
$\xi_t = e^{(\int_0^t X_u dW_u - \frac{1}{2}\int_0^t X^2_u du)}$ is a
martingale with respect to information sets $I_t$, and the probability
$\bP$, then $W^{*}_t$ , defined by

$$
W^{*}_t = W_t - \int_0^t X_u dW_u \quad t \in [0, \infty)
$$

is a Wiener process with respect to $I_t$ and with respect to the
probability measure $\bQ$ given by

$$
\bQ(A) = E^\bP(1_A\xi_T)
$$

with A being an event determined by $I_T$ and $1_A$ being the indicator
function of the event.

All this to say that basically multiplying a Wiener process with a
probability distribution $\xi_t$ gives us a new Wiener process. The two
processes are related through:

$$
dW^*_t = dW_t - X_tdt
$$

### Notes

-   $W_t$ has zero drift under $\bP$
-   $W^*_t$ has zero drift under $\bQ$
-   The definition $\bQ(A)$ is used so that for infinitesimal intervals,
    $d\bQ = \xi d \bP$
-   $\bQ(A) - E^P(1_A\xi_T) = \int 1_A \xi_T d\bP = \int_A \xi_T d\bP \rightarrow d\bQ = \xi d \bP$
-   TO remove drift, subracting the mean is usually not plausible since
    the risk premium may not be known. Sometimes switching to a
    risk-neutral setting is simpler. This is where the Girsanov Theorem
    can become a huge benefit.

## Brownian Motion

$$
\Delta X_t \sim N(\mu\Delta, \sigma^2\Delta) \\
X_t \text{ is not a martingale because }E_t[X_t] = X_t \mu(T-t) \\
Z_t = X_t - \mu t \text{ is a martingale} \Rightarrow E_t[Z_{t+T} = Z_t]
$$

### Distribution of $W_5 - W_2$

$W_5 - W_2 \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 3)$

### Lognormal

Let $Y(t) = e^{cW(t)}$

Find $E[Y(t)]$

Note $cW(t) \sim N(c^2,t)$

Thus, $E_0[Y(t)] = \exp\left(\frac{c^2 t}{2}\right)$

## Forecasting

-   $\mu_t$ is the forecast of some random variable $Y_t$ for $t \leq T$
-   The information set grows over time so that
    $I_t \subseteq I_{t+1} \subseteq \dots \subseteq I_T$
-   $\mu_t = E^P[Y_T | I_t]$ is the forecast $\mu_t$ of the random
    variable $Y_T$ given the information set $I_t$
-   Let the sequence of forecasts $\mu_t$ w.r.t probability distribution
    P and information sets $I_t$ be a martingale. Then:

$$
E^P[\mu_{t+s} | I_t] = \mu_t \rightarrow \underbrace{E^P[E^P[Y_T | I_{t+s}]|I_t]}_{\text{Tower Property}} = E^P[Y_T | I_t] = \mu_t
$$

The eq. above states that the best forecast of a future forecast is what
we forecast now since that is all the info we have.
