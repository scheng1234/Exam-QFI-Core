In the book:

-   $dF_t$ represents the total change in the derivative price
    $F(S_t, t)$.
-   $F_t$ represents the partial derivative of $F(S_t, t)$ with respect
    to t.
-   In the notes, I attempt to make things more clear by denoting the
    the first order derivative with respect to t written as $F'_t$ and
    second order as $F''_t$
    
-   $B(t,T)$: price at time t<T of a discount bond maturing at time T
-   $r-t$: instantaneous spot rate on riskless borrowing
-   $R(t,T)$: yield of the discount bond $B(t,T)$
-   $F(t,T,U)$: forward rate at time t over the period T to U
-   $F(t,s)$: instantaneous forward rate contracted at time t over the interval s to s+ds
-   $(t-T)$: Often times represents the time to maturity and in some forumalas substituted to be $\tau$
